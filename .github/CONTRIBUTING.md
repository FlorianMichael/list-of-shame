In general, I will only accept entries of projects or things I am at least vaguely aware of and that have a strong
community consensus aroudn the given opinion. Otherwise, there are 2 simple rules you need to follow when creating new entries.

## Style

Follow the style of `[<Project name>](<URL>) - <Short, tame description/example of wrongdoing>.`

An example of this would be:\
`[list-of-shame](https://github.com/kennytv/list-of-shame/) - Only there to stirr up drama, created by some upsidedown guy.`\
-> [list-of-shame](https://github.com/kennytv/list-of-shame/) - Only there to stirr up drama, created by some upsidedown
guy.

## Be sane

Don't use plain insults or very strong/discriminating language.
Don't include unfounded statements.
